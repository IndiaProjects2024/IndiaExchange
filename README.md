# IndiaExchange
IndiaExchange - a project concept to automate small business, medium scale business, and large scale business models in an innovative way.

Algorithm to allocate etf units: 

ETF Value = Price of the Product / Population of the Trading System

India Exchange will trade equities in different categories by splitting the total number of shares of existing or new company. A company can split or create different categories depending upon their requirements.

A Stock of a company can be split into Category A for Infrastructure (Owned) or Infrastructure (Rental) , Category B for Supply and Category C for Company Management (like Investment for Workforce Management, Organization Management & etc).

Exchange will be operated 24/7 for traders to participate and trades will be settled in 5-10 minutes across the world.

A Company will be allowed to create FPO (Further Public Offering) Issues regularly as per the company growth initiatives and their requirements.

Stocks with Expiration Time: For Example, If an investor invest in FMCG Products and they may incur losses if the product was not sold before the expiry day in the shop or market. We will publish products with expiration timeline in all the sectors. Competitive & Innovative Pricing Model: Electronics Products may have impact on sales due to innovation or competition in the sector.

NSE and BSE listed companies will be supported technically to migrate to India Exchange model easily.

India Exchange model will provide Balance Sheet and Key Metrics of a company in real time to traders with help of Stock Market Automation using Robotics and AI. 

We may expect to go live in coming days.
